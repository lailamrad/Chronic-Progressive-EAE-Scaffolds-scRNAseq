# Chronic-Progressive-EAE-Scaffolds-scRNAseq

1. C57/b6 mice are implanted with 13 mm PCL scaffolds on Day -14. 
2. C57/b6 mice are given adoptive transfer of MOG- or OVA-reactive T cells on Day 0.
3. Scaffolds are explanted at Day 7 (pre-symptomatic) and Day 9 (disease onset) for scRNAseq.

4. Data are in Data Den under Progressive EAE scRNAseq and code identifies each sample condition
