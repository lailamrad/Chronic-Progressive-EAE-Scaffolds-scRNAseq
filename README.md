Study Summary: A subcutaneous biomaterial implant is used as a surrogate for sampling immune cells phenotypes in murine chronic experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). These implants are microporous polycaprolactone scaffolds that form immunological niches that get vascularized and capture both innate and adaptive immune cells. These niches can be minimally invasively biopsied, allowing for multiple samples to be collected from the same mouse at various timepoints in disease: presymptomatic (Day 7) and early state disease (Day 9). This study investigates immune dynamics over time in subclinical and early stage chronic progressive EAE at a distal biomaterial-based immunological niche.

- C57/B6 mice are implanted with 13 mm PCL scaffolds on Day -14. 
- C57/B6mice are given adoptive transfer of MOG- or OVA-reactive T cells on Day 0.
- Scaffolds (pooling 2-3 biological replicates) are explanted at Day 7 (pre-symptomatic) and Day 9 (disease onset) for scRNAseq.
- scRNAseq: 10x Genomics single cell 5' kit, paired-end, Illumina NovaSeq 6000
