scRNAseq illustrates that INs contain various cell types and cell–cell communication that are dynamic with disease state. IN in mice is composed of a complex population of both immune and stromal cells (A), and these populations are altered with both time and disease in EAE models compared with OVA controls (B). The cells within these INs communicate with each other, but this cell–cell interaction is altered by disease as analyzed via CellChat (C–F). ICAM-1 signaling at d9 demonstrates reduced signal from both CD11b+ DC and Tregs in disease [MOG] (D) when compared to healthy [OVA] (C). Similarly, signaling via Itgb2 occurs in various cells (E and F), but this signaling is reduced from both CD11b + DC and Tregs in disease (F).

scRNAseq of the immunological niche shows increased CC chemokine signaling in diseased mice (when compared with OVA controls) at both d7 (A) and d9 (B). Producers of these chemokines are predominantly myeloid cells. At both time points several CC chemokine – receptor pairs are exhibiting increased signaling. All pathways shown are significantly increased in disease (compared with OVA controls) as determined via CellChat (p<0.05).

Immunological niche in mice with chronic progressive EAE exhibits extensive cell-cell communication (A-B). In healthy mice (OVA) both stromal cells and Treg produce laminin that binds CD44 on target cells, but in diseased mice (MOG) this laminin is produced only by stromal cells (C,D).Immunological niche in mice with chronic progressive EAE exhibits extensive cell-cell communication (A-B).
